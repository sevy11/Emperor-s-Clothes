# Emperor-s-Clothes

What to wear app is your personal assistant, every morning when you get out of the shower itâ€™ll tell you the 
weather for the day and what to wear for those conditions. Simply enter your wardrobe and each morning the 
app will assign a day to a clothing item to wear. The outfit it picks is based on the temperature throughout the day. It lays out two weeks of clothing options considering your preference of items. Never again will you have to spend time each morning deciding what to wear or repeating outfits from last week.
